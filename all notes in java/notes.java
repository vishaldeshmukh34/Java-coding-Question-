    //java defination: Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language that is designed to have as few implementation dependencies as possible. It is widely used for building enterprise-scale applications, mobile applications (especially Android apps), web applications, and more.
    //java features: platform independence, object-oriented, robust and secure, multithreading, high performance (with Just-In-Time compiler), rich standard library, automatic memory management (garbage collection), and portability.
    
    // what is jdk,jre and jvm?
    //JDK (Java Development Kit) is a software development kit that provides tools and libraries    
    //for developing Java applications. It includes the JRE and development tools like the compiler (javac), debugger, and other utilities.
    //JRE (Java Runtime Environment) is a part of the JDK that provides thea necessary environment to run Java applications. It includes the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), core libraries, and other components required to execute Java programs.
    //JVM (Java Virtual Machine) is an abstract machine that enables a computer to run Java programs. It interprets compiled Java bytecode and translates it into machine code that can be executed by the host operating system. The JVM is platform-dependent, meaning there are different implementations for different operating systems.       
   /// what is the difference between JDK and JRE?
   //JDK is used for developing Java applications, while JRE is used for running Java applications. JDK includes JRE along with development tools, whereas JRE only contains the runtime environment needed to execute Java programs.
 

   what is the difference between JRE and JVM?
   //JRE is a software package that provides the necessary environment to run Java applications, including the JVM and core libraries. JVM, on the other hand, is a part of the JRE that specifically interprets and executes Java bytecode. In summary, JRE is the complete runtime environment, while JVM is the component responsible for executing Java code within that environment.

   waht - are the main features of java?
   //Platform Independence: Java code can run on any platform with a compatible JVM, making it
